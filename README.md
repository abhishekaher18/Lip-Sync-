# Lip-Sync-
The Lip Sync project aims to create an AI model proficient in synchronizing audio and video, accurately matching lip movements with the corresponding audio. The model utilizes the Moviepy library in Python to manipulate video and audio files seamlessly.

You can utilize the pre-trained lip-syncing model provided in the links to accurately synchronize audio and video, creating a seamless and natural visual and auditory experience.

# Installation
To run the Lip Sync project, ensure you have Python 3.6 or above installed. The model utilizes the moviepy library in Python to manipulate video and audio files seamlessly.

# Key Features:

1. Load video and audio files, ensuring compatibility with various formats (MP4, WAV, etc.).

2. Determine the durations of the video and audio for synchronization.

3. Adjust video duration to match audio duration, either by looping the video or trimming it accordingly.

4. Synchronize the lip movements with the audio to create a visually realistic and cohesive output.

5. Save the final synchronized video with lip-synced audio for further analysis and presentation.

6. The lip-synced video will be saved at the specified output_path in MP4 format with the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.

7. The generated lip-synced video file will be stored at the specified output_path. It will also be autoplayed by the system.

# Note :
The project showcases how lip sync can be achieved programmatically, enabling applications in video editing, media production, and entertainment industries. The model's effectiveness can be assessed through visual inspection and further analysis of lip-sync accuracy. The complete code and instructions are available in the GitHub repository, along with sample inputs and outputs for demonstration.
